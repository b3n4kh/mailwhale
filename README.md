## üìÑ Description

Being a web developer, chances are high that at some point you need to teach your application how to send mails.
Essentially, there are two options. Either you use a **professional mail sending service**
like [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com), [SMTPeter](https://smtpeter.com) and the like or
you **include an SMTP client library** to your software and **plug your own mail server**.

However, if you want the best of both worlds ‚Äì that is, send mails via simple HTTP calls and with no extra complexity, 
but still use your own infrastructure ‚Äì you may want to go with ‚úâÔ∏èüê≥.

You get a simple **REST API**, which you can call to send out e-mail. You can plug your self-hosted SMTP server, as well as Google Mail or **literally any other e-mail provider**.

Stay tuned, there is a lot more to come.

## üöß Project State
The project is in a very early stage and breaking changes are likely to happen. We'd recommend to not yet use this in production or at least expect non-trivial effort required to upgrade to a new version.

## üì¶ Installation
### Compile from source
```bash
# 1. Clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/muety/mailwhale.git

# 2. Adapt config to your needs, i.e. set your SMTP server and credentials, etc.
$ cp config.default.yml config.yml
$ vi config.yml

# 3. Compile API and Web UI
$ yarn && yarn build
$ GO111MODULE=on go build

# 4. Run it
$ ./mailwhale
```

### With Docker
```bash
# 1. Clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/muety/mailwhale.git

# 2. Adapt config to your needs, i.e. set your SMTP server and credentials, etc.
$ cp config.default.yml config.yml
$ vi config.yml

# 3. Build image
$ docker build -t mailwhale .

# 4. Create persistent volume
$ docker volume create mailwhale_data

# 5. Run
$ docker run -d \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -v "$(pwd)/config.yml":/app/config.yml:ro \
  -v mailwhale_data:/data \
  --name mailwhale \
  mailwhale
```

**Note:** An official Docker image is about to come. Also, there will be no need to mount your config file into the container, as everything will be configurable using environment variables eventually. 

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage
First of all, you can get most tasks done through the web UI, available at http://localhost:3000.

### 1. Define a user
To get started with MailWhale, you need to create a **user** first. Currently, this is done through hard-coded config (see `seed_users` in [config.default.yml](config.default.yml)). Later on, once we have a web UI, there will be a way to easily sign up new users at runtime. 

### 2. Create an API client
It is good practice to not authenticate against the API as a user directly. Instead, create an **API client** with limited privileges, that could easily be revoked in the future. A client is identified by a **client ID** and a **client secret** (or token), very similar to what you might already be familiar with from AWS APIs. Usually, such a client corresponds to an individual client application of yours, which wants to access MailWhale's API. 

#### Request
```bash
$ curl -XPOST \
     -u 'admin@local.host:admin' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '{
         "description": "My juicy web app",
         "default_sender": "Epic Juice Store <noreply@epicjuicestore.org>",
         "permissions": ["send_mail"]
     }' \
     'http://localhost:3000/api/client'
```

#### Response
```
{
    "id": "SVNORFBUWGhxWGZSUUl0eA==",
    "description": "My juicy web app",
    "permissions": [
        "send_mail"
    ],
    "default_sender": "Epic Juice Store <noreply@epicjuicestore.org>",
    "allowed_senders": [
        "noreply@epicjuicestore.org"
    ],
    "api_key": "75c74447-c4af-453b-ad06-3a8ae969ed16"
}
```

The response contains your new client's ID (`id`) and secret (`api_key`). Remember these credentials, as they are needed for subsequent requests from your application.

Client authentication happens through HTTP [basic auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme). Most HTTP clients support basic auth out of the box (including cURL with its `-u` parameter). If your's doesn't, you can hash create the hash like so:

```bash
$ echo "Authorization: Basic $(echo '<client_id>:<client_secret>' | base64)"

# Result:
# Authorization: Basic U1ZOT1JGQlVXR2h4V0daU1VVbDBlQT09Ojc1Yzc0NDQ3LWM0YWYtNDUzYi1hZDA2LTNhOGFlOTY5ZWQxNg==
```

### 3. Send E-Mails

#### Plain text or HTML
```bash
$ curl -XPOST \
  -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
      "from": "Epic Juice Store <noreply@epicjuicestore.org>",
      "to": ["Jane Doe <jane@doe.com>"],
      "subject": "Dinner tonight?",
      "html": "<h1>Hey you!</h1><p>Wanna have dinner tonight?</p>"
  }' \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/mail'
```

You can also a `text` field instead, to send a plain text message.

#### Using a template
In case you have created a template using the web UI, you can reference it in a new mail like so:
```bash
$ curl -XPOST \
  -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
      "from": "Epic Juice Store <noreply@epicjuicestore.org>",
      "to": ["Jane Doe <jane@doe.com>"],
      "subject": "Dinner tonight?",
      "template_id": "8033ea08-2630-408b-82f9-d38b403243d0",
      "template_vars: {
        "text.greeting": "Hello new user!",
    }
  }' \
  'http://localhost:3000/api/mail'
```

## üöÄ Features (planned)

Right now, this app is very basic. However, there are several cool features on our roadmap.

* **Bounce handling:** Ultimately, we want to offer the ability to plug an IMAP server in addition, to get notified about
  bounced / undelivered mails.
* **Statistics:** There will be basic statistics about when which client has sent how many mails, how many were
  successful or were bounced, etc.
* **Client libraries:** To make the developer experience even smoother, client SDKs for different programming languages will we added some time.
* **Minor enhancements:** IPv6- and TLS support, API documentation, ...
